# Arduboy5x5
# 5x5 Lights Out type puzzle for an Arduboy
# 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9 grids using the standard Cross pattern and also the trickier Knights pattern.
# Also has a 'Demo' mode but moves are shuffled each time it is run.
# 11x11 grid not implemented as the 128 x 64 display is too small. 9x9 only just fits
# Sets frame rate to 15 fps and uses this to drive timing options.
